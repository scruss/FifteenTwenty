A mono-spaced font family derived from character stroke coordinates
from the Commodore 1520 plotter ROM. This has been documented here -
http://e4aws.silverdr.com/hacks/6500_1/ - and here -
https://github.com/Project-64/reloaded/tree/master/1520/rom 

This font family contains none of the original Commodore coordinates,
as they were in a format unusable with current computer systems. A
small number of glyphs were manually derived to fill out the full
ASCII set. 

Weights
-------

Bold, Demi, Regular and Light. Also supplied in a single-line
pseudo-strokefont UltraLight weight for CNC/engraving purposes. The
UltraLight variant is not recommended for general use, as it is
invisible on most screens. 

All weights also come with an Oblique version. The oblique angle
of 9.462° was chosen to fit in with the simple grid system used in the
1520 plotter ROM. 

Coverage
--------

ASCII only, with a smattering of additional graphics characters mapped
to Unicode equivalents.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Thanks to Jim Brain and other members of Project 64 Reloaded for extracting 
the ROM contents.
